# Efficient-Multiscale-Transformer (EMT)

This repository is the official implementation of the proposed architecture in the paper "Transformer-Based Thin Crack Segmentation: An Efficient Multiscale Approach for Automatic Visual Inspection".

The proposed model was trained and tested on the largest crack dataset, namely "Crack11k": (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshaymiddha/crack-segmentation-dataset/data)
